AsyncProcessor
==============
This generic class allows you to use observables to push multiple input data objects into a processing class where each input object can be processed using the specified processing function in parallel. The results of these processing tasks can be returned to a set of subscribers either in the same order they were given or the order that they completed.

Check out the console application demonstration to get an idea of how to use it.
